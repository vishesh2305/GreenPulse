We take it for granted that major plant diseases – and insect pests for that matter – have a significant impact. But what does ‘significant’ mean and how do you measure impact?

The most common and simplest measure is to give a percentage reduction in production. Common, yet not always as helpful as it sounds. First, there is the challenge of extrapolating from trials, where plants are deliberately infected or exposed to inoculum (re photo from Kenya). Second, the full impact of a plant disease should consider value of losses and the cost of control measures (re photo of potato from Syria). Sadly, the quality of available data is variable, patchy and often missing, particularly for smallholders, who produce the majority of the world’s food.

A few years back late blight attacked the tomatoes in my London suburban garden. All five plants died sans tomatoes. It was a bad year for late blight, though the more alert growers will have sprayed fungicides and some will have escaped infection. So though it’s true to say that late blight can cause 100% losses the real production losses are much less.

CIP, the international research centre with an historical mandate for potato, estimates 15% production losses each year due to late blight. USAblight (a national project on lb on potato and tomato) says that (annual) global losses ‘exceed US$6.7 billion’. Knowing the financial costs of a plant disease tells you much more about its impact. It also makes for cogent research proposals, as a US colleague explained. A proposal to study a sugarcane disease was magically transformed when my friend and collaborators said they aimed to save industry tens of millions of dollars. Reducing losses by 3% sounded much tamer. They got the grant.

The economic costs of late blight have been estimated from fungicide sales in the US and Europe, elsewhere less reliably. There still seems to be much wagging of wet fingers in the air when estimating production losses and especially the economic costs of plant diseases to farmers. When market prices for potatoes are high, the loss of 15% production may not matter so much. When farmers in the UK were being paid around £60 per tonne for wheat, the marginal cost of spraying against aphids (which transmit viruses) rose hugely. You were damned if you sprayed, making little or no profit, and under greater risk from disease if you didn’t, tipping break-even into a loss.

Each year the World Health Organisation says how many people die from malaria and other major human diseases. I assume they compute the number from data supplied by Ministries of Health around the world. Try asking Ministries of Agriculture for similar data on plant disease losses. Indeed, it’s difficult to see who is coordinating such data and even asking for such information. FAO? World Bank? Good data do exist on the impact of plant diseases, but it is widely dispersed and difficult to find. Which makes a study we carried out in Bolivia, led by Jeff Bentley, of unusual interest.

If you want to see how to monitor disease impact, go to the US. All hats off to the University of Georgia, Cooperative Extension (UGCE) for publishing detailed estimates of crop losses. Their annual reports make for fascinating reading. Here’s the first paragraph from the 2008 report: “It is estimated that losses due to plant diseases in Georgia in 2008 amounted to $612 million. These losses include actual losses in yield and quality as well as costs of disease control measures. The value of these crops was approximately $4,846 million, which resulted in a 12% total disease loss for crops grown in 2008.”

Just to repeat: in one year, in one US state, the plant diseases resulted in over half a billion US dollars of damage. It’s a powerful statement on impact that highlights the need for continuing research and public investment in extension services. Plant pathologists have used models to predict production losses. A landmark review by Oerke in 2006 on ‘Crop losses to pests’ and is widely quoted (over 800 citations). Yet we are still missing good data on the costs and therefore true impact of plant diseases.

One of the reasons for the review’s popularity, is that it provides an easy way to justify initiatives on ‘food security’, despite the caveats on data interpretation made clear in the main text. Call it the ‘curse of the abstract’, for I suspect that few who quote Oerke to justify 40% losses across the board have actually read the paper. Such a figure sounds both too much (for production losses) and inadequate to explain the true impact of plant diseases in terms of lost income and control costs.

If Georgia can estimate economic losses then so can others. The impact of plant diseases is something that the BSPP might look at more carefully, holding joint meetings with health and agricultural economists for example. How about summer internships and fellowships? Apply here!`

        title: "Watch out for these five cabbage pests",

Cabbage is a globally important vegetable crop. It serves as a valuable source of nutrition and income for local communities. With a wide range of varieties around the world – from Savoy to Bok Choy – it is an important component of many cuisines. Smallholder farmers often cultivate cabbage as a cash crop.
Like many other important agricultural crops, cabbage is susceptible to significant damage by plant pests. For smallholder farmers who lack access to reliable information and agricultural inputs, this can have a significant negative impact on yields.

In addition, climate change affects the prevalence and distribution of pests. Warmer temperatures and unpredictable rain patterns can affect the timing and severity of infestations. This can increase the challenges already faced by smallholder farmers.

Here are five pests that threaten cabbage cultivation.
1.Cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae)
 Cabbage aphids are tiny insects measuring 2-2.5 mm. They have a greyish waxy coating that gives them a dusty, grey, or white appearance They are found in clusters of various colours from greenish to grey and black. They cause severe damage to crops like cabbage, cauliflower and radish. The aphids feed by extracting sap from their host plants, excreting sweet honeydew that attracts ants. In exchange, the ants protect aphids from natural enemies. Their feeding deforms leaves, leading to leaf curl, particularly in older plants. Prolonged feeding results in the plant yellowing, wilting, and stunting. These aphids can cause substantial yield losses.
2. Cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae)
The cabbage butterfly is a notorious pest of cruciferous crops. The caterpillars devour leaves, stripping them down to their veins. Young larvae hatch on the outer leaves, causing superficial damage, leaving the upper leaf surface intact. As they mature, they create holes in the leaves, often chewing through small veins. The adult cabbage butterflies lay clusters of yellow eggs on the undersides of leaves, where the small larvae will feed on the tender leaf portions. In severe infestations, plants may be reduced to a skeleton, with all leaf tissue eaten. Attacks of this pest intensify in warmer temperatures.

3. Dark leaf spot of cabbage (Alternaria brassicicola)
Cabbage bacterial leaf spot, caused by the fungal pathogen, Alternaria brassicicola, is a prevalent foliar disease. It affects crops including cabbage, cauliflower, kale, brussels sprouts, and broccoli. Even minor infections can render crops unsellable. Severe cases lead to reduced yields because of leaf loss or low weight. The disease manifests as small dark spots on leaves, which may merge to form irregular dead areas limited by the leaf veins. Gradually, the entire foliage turns yellow and deteriorates. Thriving in damp conditions, the bacteria enter plants through any damage, even the minute, like sand blowing against the leaves. The bacteria rely on insects, rain splashes, or weeding tools to transport them.

4. Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella)
The diamondback moth is a global threat to cruciferous plants, including cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower. Its voracious larvae cause severe damage by feeling on leaves, often rendering crops unmarketable. These small caterpillars reproduce rapidly, leading to multiple generations within one growing season. The larvae strip foliage down to the veins, which is especially harmful to seedlings. Adults lay eggs on the leaves, and upon hatching, the larvae start to consume the leaves. The larvae may also dangle from silk threads when disturbed. Even if the plant tissue damage is minimal, the mere presence of the larvae can result in the rejection of produce. This pest is a serious concern for growers worldwide.

5.Cabbage root fly (Delia radicum)
Cabbage root fly maggots, which resemble common house flies, pose a threat to the roots of brassicas as well as swedes, turnips, and radishes, by burrowing into their roots. The legless, headless larvae can devastate seedlings and recently transplanted plants, creating entry points for disease-causing pathogens like blackleg and soft rot. Cold-season crops are particularly vulnerable, often displaying signs such as wilting, pale foliage, and stunted growth when affected by these destructive pests. To protect your cabbage crops, it’s essential to recognize and address infestations promptly.`

Pests and diseases of rice are a significant constraint in rice production, accounting for up to 30% of yield losses. Rice is cultivated in over 100 countries and is a staple food source for over half the world’s population. Therefore, the sustainable management of rice pests and diseases is essential if we are to feed our growing population. 

In this blog, we look at five pests and diseases threatening rice production.

1. Nilaparvata lugens (brown planthopper)
Brown planthoppers are probably the most serious insect pest of rice in Asia, causing severe damage and reduced crop yields. These small, flying insects suck sap from rice plants, causing them to wilt and eventually die. The feeding damage is commonly referred to as ‘hopper burn’. Hopperburn begins in patches and rapidly spreads as planthoppers move from plant to plant. 
Using resistant rice varieties and removing weeds from filed bunds can help manage the problem. 

2. Leptocorisa oratorius (slender rice bug) 

Slender leaf bugs are notorious for damaging rice grains directly. Adult and nymph rice bugs have piercing-sucking mouth parts that they use to cut the grain hulls and feed on the developing kernels. Their feeding activity can result in partially filled or empty grains. As a result, slender rice bugs are responsible for significant yield losses. 

Slender rice bugs can survive on weeds and grasses around paddy fields, which causes significant problems for control strategies. Cultural control options include the cultivation of bunds around paddy fields and the periodic burning of grass grown on the bunds and fallow fields. 

3. Rhizoctonia solani (rice sheath blight) 

Rice sheath blight is a fungal disease that attacks rice plants, causing dark lesions on the sheaths and leaves. These lesions can expand rapidly, girdling the plant and leading to wilting and death. The fungus survives in the soil and floats on the standing water of the rice field. It spreads quickly in high humidity conditions and can devastate entire paddy fields. 
Recommended preventative measures include clean cultivation to eliminate the disease-causing fungus and crop rotation. 

4. Scirpophaga incertulas (yellow stem borer) 

Yellow Stem Borers are a severe pest of rice, particularly in Asia. In regions where it occurs, it is found in almost every rice field, in each rice season. 

Yellow stem borers are the larvae of a moth species that bore into rice stems, disrupting nutrient flow and weakening the plant’s structure. Infested plants exhibit ‘dead hearts,’ where the central shoot dies, leading to stunted growth and reduced yields. This pest is particularly challenging to control due to its hidden feeding behaviour. 

Scirpophaga incertulas has a large complex of natural enemies; however, these mainly occur at low levels. Conservation of these natural enemies is essential to maximize natural biological control.

5. Pomacea canaliculata (invasive apple snail) 
Invasive apple snails are a significant threat to rice crops. These invasive aquatic snails feed on young rice seedlings. The first symptom of damage is a reduced plant stand where snails have severed the plant stalk below the water level. They have a voracious appetite – a large adult snail can consume a blade of rice in 3-5 min. The life cycle of the invasive apple snail and its ability to grow and reproduce quickly make it a particular menace for rice farmers.`

Maize is an important crop, grown by smallholder farmers around the world. It is a staple food in the diets of millions and is vital for food and economic security. However, there are a number of pests and diseases that attack maize and limit yields. Below we outline four pests and diseases of maize and how to spot them.

1. Head smut Sphacelotheca reiliana
Head smut is a disease caused by a fungus that infects tassels, ears, and occasionally leaves. It can spread via wind and can survive for years in the soil.

The fungus lives on the maize ear, causing black masses to form there. It penetrates and develops inside the plant, but does not appear until flowering or cob formation. The black masses contain spores, or fungal seeds, that contaminate other plants.

2. African maize stalk borer Busseola fusca
The maize stalk or stem borer is a widespread pest, found throughout tropical and sub-tropical areas of Africa, and is one of the major pests of maize. Busseola fusca larvae damage all plant parts of the crops they attack. If farmers do not use controls then infestations can cause yield losses as high as 50%.

3. Fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda
In 2016, the Fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) was found in Africa for the first time. It is a lepidopteran pest native to the Americas that feeds in large numbers on leaves and stems of more than 80 plant species, causing major damage to maize, sorghum, sugarcane but also other vegetable crops, and cotton. The life cycle of the fall armyworm and its ability to spread and reproduce quickly makes it an incredibly successful invasive species.

4. Maize lethal necrosis disease
Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease (MLND) can be devastating for farmers, causing low yields to total crop failure, and is an important food security issue. A combination of two viruses causes MLND, the Maize Chlorotic Mottle Virus (MCMoV) and any of the cereal viruses in the Potyviridae group, like the Sugarcane Mosaic Virus (SCMV), Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus (WSMV) or Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus (MDMV). The double infection of the two viruses gives rise to what is known as MLND, also referred to as Corn Lethal Necrosis (CLN).

Vectors spread the disease, transmitting it from plant to plant and field to field. The most common vectors are maize thrips, rootworms, and leaf beetles.`

Conservation farming has been promoted in sub-Saharan Africa as a way to potentially improve yields while conserving the environment. Farmer livelihoods are increasingly threatened by climate change, declining soil fertility, land degradation, pests, and diseases. Finding sustainable farming methods that address these challenges is key to feeding a growing population.

Conservation farming principles
Conservation farming aims to prevent the loss of arable land through three main principles – crop residue retention, crop rotation and minimal soil disturbance. What is more, there has been some evidence to suggest conservation farming can help improve smallholder crop yields. A new CABI-led study looks at whether this method of farming can offset the negative yield impacts of fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) in Zambia.

The benefits
There are several ways conservation farming may protect crops against FAW. It generates favourable microclimates where natural enemies can thrive, crop rotation disrupts the FAW life-cycle, and it supports healthy plant growth so crops are more likely to survive pest outbreaks. These are important advantages given FAW’s devastating impact in the region.

The barriers
However, despite these potential benefits, uptake of the three principles of conservation farming has been low. It requires high outlays for equipment and increased labour, plus, high opportunity costs linked to retaining crop residues, which many farmers use for livestock feed or fuel.

Using data from 1,048 smallholder maize plots across the major maize-growing areas in Zambia, the CABI-led study aims to understand: (1) the factors determining smallholders’ use of some or all of conservation farming practices; (2) whether conservation farming can raise maize yields even in periods of FAW outbreak; and (3) the mixed effects of conservation technology packages on smallholder maize yields under FAW stress.

Conservation farming – use by Zambian farmers
The study found that many Zambian smallholders use some of the conservation farming principles. However, only 26% of farmers used all three techniques. The reasons provided covered tenure insecurity, livestock raising, credit constraints, off-farm employment, and agro-climatic conditions.

There was some evidence that crop rotation, alone or in combination with crop residue retention, increased maize yields under FAW stress. However, minimum soil disturbance did not affect yields. The authors stated that farmers using improved seeds and agrochemicals were more likely to see better yield outcomes. Therefore, smallholders using conservation farming techniques – whether some or all – should supplement with better-quality seeds and pesticides to maximise their maize yields.

Pesticide use
One point highlighted by the authors is the use of pesticides to tackle FAW outbreaks. Sub-Saharan Africa has been hit hard by the invasive fall armyworm and farmers have relied heavily on pesticides to fight the pest. Some of the chemicals used are highly hazardous to human health and the environment and farmers are unlikely to use the recommended personal protective equipment. As such, the use of safer and environmentally friendly alternatives such as biopesticides and agro-ecological approaches should be promoted, as well as the development of maize varieties that are resistant to FAW.`
